# Normal-Distribution-R-studio--Example
Learning Normal Distribution in R studio


# Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In graph form, normal distribution will appear as a bell curve.

# Where Mean,Median and Mode are in centre

# To calculate Normal Dsitribution we need to have mean and SD value

# We need to find out probability between score 300-600

# We Know Mean score = 494, and SD = 100
